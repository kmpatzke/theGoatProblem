This is a small simulation which is supposed to solve the so called goat problem. The goat problem: We are situated in a game show and the game is to choose between three doors. One is hiding a car which we want to have. The other two are hiding a goat. After we decided for one door the game show master opens one of the other doors and it reveals a goat. Now the question is if you want to stick to the choice you made in the first place or switch to the door left.

There are two Versions of the program. The first one is in the "Manuell"-folder is.... guess what the version where you can make the choices yourself in a console application to get a feeling which choice leads most likely to which result.

The other Version is in the "Automatic"-folder and is  simulation where you simply decide how many rounds the game is played. In that case the program always chooses two switch doors and prints the number of won rounds to the console.
